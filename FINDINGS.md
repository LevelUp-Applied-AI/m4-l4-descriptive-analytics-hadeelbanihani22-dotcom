# Student Performance EDA — Findings

## 1. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains student academic performance information including GPA,
study hours, attendance, department, internships, and scholarships.

Missing values were handled as follows:
- commute_minutes: filled using median imputation
- study_hours_weekly: rows with missing values removed
Shape: 
(2000, 10)
coloumns:
student_id                str
department                str
semester                  str
course_load             int64
study_hours_weekly    float64
gpa                   float64
attendance_pct        float64
has_internship            str
commute_minutes       float64
scholarship               str

notable data quality issues :
there is a two missing values cloumns (commute_minutes and scholarship) we handle it as we sayed above

## 2. Distribution Insights

- GPA distribution appears approximately normal.
(see  ![alt text](output\gpa_distribution.png))
- Study hours show *moderate variability* with slight *right skewness*, indicating a smaller group of students studies substantially more than average.
(see output\study_hours_weekly_distribution.png)
- Attendance percentage is generally high across students.
(see ![alt text](output/attendance_pct_distribution.png))
- Box plots comparing GPA across departments show overlapping ranges and similar medians, suggesting comparable academic performance between departments.
(see  ![alt text](output\gpa_by_department_boxplot.png))

## 3. Correlation Analysis
The correlation heatmap shows a strong positive relationship between
study hours and GPA.

Pearson correlation test:
- Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.64
- p-value <  0.0000

This indicates a statistically significant positive correlation between
study hours and academic performance.

## 4. Hypothesis Testing

### T-test: Internship vs GPA
- H0: Mean GPA is equal for students with and without internships.
- H1: Mean GPA differs between the two groups.
- T-statistic = 14.2288
- p-value < 0.0000

Students with internships have significantly different GPAs compared
to students without internships.

Effect size (Cohen's d) = 0.7061

This represents a medium-to-large practical effect, indicating that
the GPA difference is not only statistically significant but also
meaningful in practice.
---

### ANOVA: GPA Across Departments
- F-statistic: 0.6671
- p-value = 0.6148

No statistically significant GPA differences were found between departments.

---

### Chi-Square Test: Scholarship vs Department
- Chi-square statistic = 13.9486
- p-value = 0.3040
- Degrees of freedom = 12

The result is not statistically significant, indicating that
scholarship status does not appear to be associated with
academic department.

## 5. Key Takeaways
- Study hours strongly influence GPA.
- Internship experience is associated with GPA differences.
- Academic performance is consistent across departments.

---

## 6. Conclusion
Exploratory data analysis revealed meaningful academic patterns.
Study behavior and practical experience appear more influential
than departmental affiliation.

## 7. Recommendations

1. Encourage structured study programs since study hours show a strong
   positive relationship with GPA.

2. Expand internship opportunities, as students with internships
   demonstrate higher academic performance.

3. Maintain consistent academic standards across departments,
   as no significant GPA differences were observed.
